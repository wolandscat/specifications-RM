= Uri Package

== Overview

The `data_types.uri` package includes two types used for referring to information resources. The
`DV_URI` type allows data values which are references to objects on the world wide web to be created. The specialisation `DV_OPENEHR_URI` provides a representation for URIs that may be used within an openEHR data environment, i.e. to refer to any openEHR data artefact, including in the EHR, demographics, or future artefact types such as guidelines, plan etc.

The final specialisation, `DV_EHR_URI`, provides the specific semantics for representing as a URI the reference to any element in an openEHR EHR. The `DV_EHR_URI` type is convenient, because it is a string, like any other URI, and is therefore easily transportable and processable. Because it has its own scheme space, 'ehr', instances can be globally unique, as long as EHR identification is globally unique. `DV_EHR_URIs` are used to express all runtime paths in the EHR. The `uri` Package is illustrated below.

=== Requirements

This package meets the requirement for a `DATA_VALUE` subtype which represents a W3C Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI). A common example of where this might be used is to represent a reference
to a clinical guideline or other justifying document associated with an intervention or treatment plan
recorded in the EHR.

URIs are a superset of Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) (although the two are often confused,
even within the W3C), and can be used to specify the location of any information item, regardless of
its type, location or storage method, as long as a URI "scheme" exists for that type of information.

There is an additional requirement for a kind of URI that can point at an EHR data item, either inside
the same EHR containing the link, or in another EHR. This is the basis of implementing logical references
in the EHR and between EHRs.

=== Design

A simple design approach is used whereby a URI is represented as a String, and appropriate functions are defined to extract the various parts according to the syntax of URIs defined by Tim Berners-Lee ({rfc3986}[IETF RFC 3986^]). An EHR specific subtype is defined, whose scheme is 'ehr', and which contains further attributes enabling the instances of the type to record what kind of object they are referring to.

So-called 'plain-text URIs' that contain RFC-3986 forbidden characters such as spaces etc, are allowed on the basis of human readability, but must be RFC-3986 encoded prior to use in e.g. REST APIs or other contexts relying on machine-level conformance.

== Definitions

The following symbolic definitions are used in the classes below.

== Syntaxes

=== DV_OPENEHR_URI Syntax

The syntax of a `DV_OPENEHR_URI` is an openEHR path within any openEHR-defined data instance, scoped by any URI scheme-space used in openEHR.

=== DV_EHR_URI Syntax

The syntax of a `DV_EHR_URI` is an openEHR path, inside the 'ehr' URI scheme-space, and takes one of the forms:

----
ehr://system_id/ehr_id/top_level_structure_locator/path_inside_top_level_structure
ehr:/ehr_id
ehr:/ehr_id/top_level_structure_locator
ehr:/ehr_id/top_level_structure_locator/path_inside_top_level_structure 
----

The syntax is described in more detail in the {openehr_overview}#_ehr_uris[openEHR Architecture Overview]. `DV_EHR_URIs` are used as a mechanism for referencing in the EHR, ensuring readability by humans, as well as validity when extracts are transmitted elsewhere: even if the target of a path is not present, the path can be used to locate the missing item on demand.
