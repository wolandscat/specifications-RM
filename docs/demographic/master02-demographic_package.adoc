= Demographic package

== Overview

The demographic model illustrated in the UML diagram below is a generalised model of the facts one might expect to see in a demographic server. The purpose of the model is as a specification of a demographic service, either standalone, or a "wrapper" service for an existing system such as a patient master index (PMI). In the latter situation, it is used to add the required openEHR semantics, particularly versioning,
to an existing service.

The general design is based on the scheme of party and accountability described by cite:[Fowler1997], and is influenced by clinical adaptations including work done in Australia and {hl7v3}[HL7v3^] (itself influenced by the Fowler models).

One of the main design criteria of the model is that it expresses attributes and relationships of demographic entities which exist regardless of particular clinical involvements or participations in particular events. Participations are meaningful only within the context of the health record or other relevant model where they record context-specific relationships between demographic entities and events in the real world.

Another criterion is that instances of the classes in the model must be serialisable into an EHR Extract in an unambgiuous way. This requires that each `PARTY` be a self-contained hierarchy of data, in the same way as distinct `COMPOSITIONs` in the EHR model are distinct hierarchies in an Extract. In order to ensure this condition, `PARTY_RELATIONSHIPs` must be implemented correctly, so as to prevent endless traversal of all `PARTY` objects through their relationships, when serialising. See <<_party_relationships>> below for details.

=== Archetyping

The model is designed to be used with archetypes, hence the generic nature of all entities. Every class containing an attribute of the form `_details_:STRUCTURE` is a completely archetypable structure. As a result, archetypes can be defined for concepts such as particular kinds of `PERSON`, `ORGANISATION`; for actual `ROLEs` such as "health care practitioner", and for party identities and addresses.

=== Names and Addresses

Classes have been included for `PARTY_IDENTITY` and `ADDRESS`, even though they contain only a link to details, in the form of the generic `STRUCTURE` class. This is not strictly necessary - it could have been done simply using appropriately named attributes in the classes `PARTY` and `CONTACT` - but is done to provide a place to add specific semantics in future releases of the model. It is also expected to make software development easier, since it provides explicit classes to which behaviour and other implementation attributes can be added. Lastly, it allows the notions of `PARTY_IDENTITY` and `ADDRESS` to be explicitly used in archetype-authoring tools.

Instances of `PARTY_IDENTITY`, linked to `PARTY` by the attribute `_identities_` are intended to express the names of people, organisations, and other actors - that is names which are "owned" by the party, e.g.  self-declared (in the case of institutions and companies) or by virtue of social relations (names given by parents, tribes etc). Identifiers of Parties given by other organisations, or the state are not represented in this way, and should be recorded in the `PARTY._details_` structure instead (see below).

=== Party Identification

Identifiers of Parties given by organisations or the state are treated as any other attribute of a Party, i.e. recorded as part of the data in the `PARTY._details_` structure. Identifiers of Party instances in the system are provided in the same way as identifiers of Compositions in the EHR: via the `_uid_` attribute (type `OBJECT_VERSION_ID`) of the containing `VERSION`. These identifiers are used in all cross-references between Parties, and between Parties and Party_relationships.

=== Party Relationships

Relationships between parties in the real world may be expressed using `PARTY_RELATIONSHIP` objects, as illustrated below.

.General Relationship Model

Relationships are considered directional, hence the use of the attribute names source and target, however, these names are otherwise neutral, and give no indication as to the meaning of the relationships, such as which party is responsible and which accountable (for comparison, see the demographic models of Fowler cite:[Fowler1997]). Accordingly, each Party involved in a relationship includes it in its relationships list, if it is at the source end.

The usual way to determine the directionality of a relationship between two Parties is usually by which Partyâ€™s actions caused the relationship to come into being. For example, a relationship representing the concept "patient", between a health consumer and a health care organisation would have the consumer as source and the organisation as target.

`PARTY_RELATIONSHIPs` are stored as part of the data of the `PARTY` designated as the source. This means that the relationships attribute is by value, while the `PARTY_RELATIONSHIP._source_` and `_target_` are represented by references. The actual kind of reference is via the use of `OBJECT_REFs` containing `HIER_OBJECT_IDs` to denote the Version container of a Party, rather than `OBJECT_VERSION_IDs`, which would denote particular versions. Logically this implements the semantic that such relationships in the real world are between _continuants_, i.e. the real Parties, not just one of their version instances in a demographic system.

=== Versioning Semantics

The class `PARTY` and its descendants `ACTOR` and `ROLE` are all potentially versioned in a demographic system. A Version of a `PARTY` includes all the compositional parts, such as identities, contacts, Party relationships of which it is the source. Every Party is stored in its own Version container.

== Instance Examples

In the following instance examples, the values of the attributes `_uid_`, `_source_` and `_target_` are not meant to be taken as literally valid `OBJECT_IDs`: for the purposes of clarity, simple integers have been used.

=== Parties

==== Person

The diagram below illustrates a possible set of instances for a `PERSON`, with home and work contact information.  There are separate archetypes for the `PERSON`, each `ADDRESS`, and each `PARTY_IDENTITY`. In the following figure, "meaning" is the meaning from the value of the `_archetype_node_id_` attribute, functionally derived from the archetype local ontology.

==== Clinician

==== Credentials

==== Health Care Facility

==== Group

The figure below illustrates the demographic information for a cardiac surgery team in a hospital. The group includes a head surgeon, anaesthetist, assistant surgeon, and presumably others (not shown). Each of these members of the team have an employment relationship with the hospital (shown only for one surgeon, in the interests of clarity).

=== Relationships

==== Patient

The figure below shows a simple way of representing the patient relationship between a person and a health
care organisation.

The following diagram shows the same logical relationship, but with both Parties acting through Roles, representing their status as healthcare consumer and healthcare provider respectively. Each of these Roles has associated credentials which document its official nature within the healthcare system.
